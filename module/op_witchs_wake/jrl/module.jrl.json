To designate your character as one of these subraces, restart the module and type the subrace name into your character's subrace field during character creation. Note that the bonuses and penalties outlined below are applied on top of any existing racial modifiers. Also, any skill bonuses require you to gain one point in that skill before the bonus ranks are made available. The subraces for the Witch's Wake series are as follows:\n\nDWARF: CAIRN\n   Long exiled from their traditional homelands down below, these hardy, grey-skinned dwarves live in nomadic bands upon the surface, occasionally settling down to form small villages. They get their name from their tradition of interring their dead in rocky cairns so as not to break the terms of their exile. The Barrow Dwarves, followers of Brogan Nachtjager, are considered a heretical offshoot of the Cairn Dwarves.\n   Favored Class: Barbarian\n   Properties:\n      -2 Dex\n      +2 Con\n      -2 Cha\n      +1 AC\n      +1 Fortitude Saves\n      +1 Reflex Saves\n      -1 Will Saves\n\nDWARF: LOREKEEPER\n   Buried deep within their mountain fortresses, Lorekeeper Dwarves pursue a solemn life of ascetic monasticism. They value knowledge and awareness above all else, dedicating themselves to the creation, maintainance, and study of vast underground libraries. Many make pilgrimages to the surface world in search of new books and reports of wars and famines in distant lands.\n   Favored Class: Wizard\n   Properties:\n      -2 Str\n      +2 Int\n      +2 Wis\n      +2 Save vs Mind-Affecting Spells\n      -1 Fortitude Save\n      +4 Lore\n      +4 Spellcraft\n\nELF: NOMAD\n   The rugged, pale-eyed Elves known to the world as Nomads are said to never lay their heads in the same place twice. Calling themselves 'The Forgotten Ones' or 'Those Left Behind,' they pace restlessly across the lands in ones or twos, in search of vengeance. Quick to anger and slow to heal, ill talk tends to follow in their wake.\n   Favored Class: Fighter\n   Properties:\n      +2 Str\n      -2 Dex\n      +2 Con\n      -2 Wis\n      -2 Cha\n      +1 Save vs Disease\n      +1 Save vs Death Magic\n      +1 Save vs Poison\n      75% Immunity to Negative Energy\n      50% Vulnerability to Divine Damage\n      50% Vulnerability to Positive Energy\n      -1 Reflex Save\n      Immune to Cure Spells\n\nELF: SHADOW\n   The so-called Elves of the Shadow have come to dominate much of Elven society, especially in its urban centers. Quick-witted and decadent, they play out their countless intriques against each other in the Elven courts, the other races serving as unwitting pawns in their endless gambit for power.\n   Favored Class: Rogue\n   Properties:\n      +2 Int\n      -2 Cha\n      +1 AC vs Good\n      25% Vulnerability to Positive Energy\n      10% Immunity to Negative Energy\n      Darkvision\n      +2 Hide\n      +2 Move Silently\n\nELF: SYLVAN\n   Some Elves still linger in the ancient forests, holding fast to the old ways and the teachings of the firstmen. They are few in number, however, and the forests are but a ghost of their former selves. Leaders among the Sylvan Elves claim that the world is ending and that they will be there when it does.\n   Favored Class: Ranger\n   Properties:\n      -2 Int\n      +2 Cha\n      +2 AC vs Elementals\n      50% Vulnerability to Fire\n      +4 Animal Empathy\n      Tracking\n\nGNOME: DEEP\n   Hardly miners in the traditional sense, Deep Gnomes have a raven-like fascination for all things shiny. Though they prize mirrors above all else, they are loathe to part with even the least of their baubles. This has earned them a reputation as sadistic and suspicious tricksters - many a thief has met a painful and embarrassing end trying to steal from a Deep Gnome's treasury.\n   Favored Class: Rogue\n   Properties:\n      +2 Dex\n      +2 Wis\n      -4 Cha\n      +1 AC vs Good\n      25% Vulnerability to Positive Energy\n      10% Immunity to Negative Energy\n      Darkvision\n      +2 Hide\n      +2 Move Silently\n\nGNOME: TINKER\n   Industrious and often obsessed, Tinker Gnomes are renowned crafters. Unlike their more reclusive, subterranean brethren, Tinkers are talkative and outgoing, wandering constantly from town to town in search of new supplies and markets for their often useless creations. Every leap year, they gather for a Grand Crafting, a festive exchange of unsold wares that they can cannibalize for parts over the coming seasons. \n   Favored Class: Wizard\n   Properties:\n      -2 Con\n      +2 Int\n      -2 Wis\n      +2 Appraise\n      +4 Craft Armor\n      +4 Craft Weapon\n      +4 Craft Trap\n      +2 Disarm Trap\n      +2 Set Trap\n      +2 Open Lock\n      +4 Use Magic Device\n\nHALF-ELF: AIR-TOUCHED\n   Lithe, graceful and free-willed, it is said the Air-Touched are distant descendents of the firstmen, born only among those of human ancestry. Such births are rare, often skipping many generations, but they are always seen as signs of great import. Some societies treat the Touched with holy reverence while others consider them beasts to be hunted and feared. Whatever the case, they are almost always set apart from the rest of their kith and kin.\n   Favored Class: Rogue\n   Properties:\n      -2 Str\n      +2 Dex\n      +2 Int\n      -2 Wis\n      +2 AC vs Law\n      10% Immunity to Cold\n      10% Immunity to Electricity\n      25% Vulnerability to Magical Damage\n\nHALF-ELF: PEREGRINE\n   Surrounded by a nimbus of light wherever they go, Peregrines are often considered to be somehow either Angelic in origin or Angelic by nature. All the same, the jails of the land are often full of them, each one imprisoned for some crime of treason or passion or despair. It is said they love too fully, too impulsively, rarely able to see the wider consequences of their actions.\n   Favored Class: Paladin\n   Properties:\n      -2 Con\n      -2 Int\n      +2 Wis\n      +2 Cha\n      +2 AC vs Evil\n      25% Immunity to Positive Energy\n      25% Vulnerability to Negative Energy\n      10% Vulnerability to Fire\n      Light: Dim (White)\n\nHALF-ELF: NOMAD\n   The rugged, pale-eyed Elves known to the world as Nomads are said to never lay their heads in the same place twice. Calling themselves 'The Forgotten Ones' or 'Those Left Behind,' they pace restlessly across the lands in ones or twos in search of vengeance. Quick to anger and slow to heal, ill talk tends to follow in their wake.\n   Favored Class: Fighter\n   Properties:\n      +2 Str\n      -2 Dex\n      +2 Con\n      -2 Wis\n      -2 Cha\n      +1 Save vs Disease\n      +1 Save vs Death Magic\n      +1 Save vs Poison\n      75% Immunity to Negative Energy\n      50% Vulnerability to Divine Damage\n      50% Vulnerability to Positive Energy\n      -1 Reflex Save\n      Immune to Cure Spells\n\nHALF-ELF: SHADOW\n   The so-called Elves of the Shadow have come to dominate much of Elven society, especially in its urban centers.

They are few in number, however, and the forests are but a ghost of their former selves.

Given the aura of red light that seems to follow them, some argue that they must be devilspawn or agents of Stygia. More rational voices, however, insist that they must be lingering vestiges from the time of the firstmen, much like their elemental brethren, the Touched.\n   Favored Class: Wizard\n   Properties:\n      +1 Str\n      -2 Con\n      +2 Int\n      -2 Cha\n      +2 AC vs Good\n      25% Immunity to Negative Energy\n      25% Vulnerability to Positive Energy\n      10% Vulnerability to Cold\n      Light: Dim (Red)\n\nHALF-ELF: WATER-TOUCHED\n   Mysterious, enduring, and mercurial, it is said the Water-Touched are distant descendents of the firstmen, born only among those of human ancestry. Such births are rare, often skipping many generations, but they are always seen as signs of great import. Some societies treat the Touched with holy reverence while others consider them beasts to be hunted and feared. Whatever the case, they are almost always set apart from the rest of their kith and kin.\n   Favored Class: Paladin\n   Properties:\n      -2 Dex\n      +2 Con\n      -2 Int\n      +2 Cha\n      +2 AC vs Chaos\n      10% Immunity to Acid\n      10% Immunity to Fire\n      25% Vulnerability to Cold\n\nHALF-ORC: EARTH-TOUCHED\n   Stalwart, loyal, and wise, it is said the Earth-Touched are distant descendents of the firstmen, born only among those of human ancestry.

All the same, the jails of the land are often full of them, each one imprisoned for some crime of treason or passion or despair. It is said they love too fully, too impulsively, rarely able to see the wider consequences of their actions.\n   Favored Class: Cleric\n   Properties:\n      -2 Con\n      -2 Int\n      +2 Wis\n      +2 Cha\n      +2 AC vs Evil\n      25% Immunity to Positive Energy\n      25% Vulnerability to Negative Energy\n      10% Vulnerability to Fire\n      Light: Dim (White)\n\nHALF-ORC: SOJOURNER\n   Abstaining from all worldy concerns, Sojourner Orcs consider themselves pilgrims along their inevitable deathward journey. Though deeply spiritual, they hold to no organized religion, as each Sojourner is left to chart his or her own path. They often integrate weapons training into their meditations and those who enter into battle are veritable juggernaughts, showing little fear of death.\n   Favored Class: Fighter\n   Properties:\n      -4 Dex\n      +4 Con\n      +1 Save vs Disease\n      +1 Save vs Death Magic\n      +1 Save vs Poison\n      90% Immunity to Negative Energy\n      75% Vulnerability to Divine Damage\n      75% Vulnerability to Positive Energy\n      -2 Natural AC\n      Immune to Cure Spells\n\nHALF-ORC: TAINTED\n   Considered sullen and devious by some, resourceful and far-thinking by others, few seem to agree on the nature and origins of the Tainted. Given the aura of red light that seems to follow them, some argue that they must be devilspawn or agents of Stygia. More rational voices, however, insist that they must be lingering vestiges from the time of the firstmen, much like their elemental brethren, the Touched.\n   Favored Class: Wizard\n   Properties:\n      +1 Str\n      -2 Con\n      +2 Int\n      -2 Cha\n      +2 AC vs Good\n      25% Immunity to Negative Energy\n      25% Vulnerability to Positive Energy\n      10% Vulnerability to Cold\n      Light: Dim (Red)\n\nHALFLING: FERAL\n   Wild and savage, these forest-dwelling Halflings are fiercely territorial, harassing passing travelers and the Sylvan Elves alike (although steps are being taken towards a uneasy truce with the latter). Though no match for their Imperial brethren in the open field, Feral Halflings have successfully managed to hem in the Empire's western expansion despite numerous campaigns to break them. \n   Favored Class: Druid\n   Properties:\n      +2 Dex\n      -2 Int\n      +2 Wis\n      -2 Cha\n      +2 AC vs Law\n      +1 AC vs Neutral\n      -1 Natural AC\n      10% Immunity to Cold\n      10% Immunity to Fire\n      10% Vulnerability to Slashing\n      Tracking\n      +4 Animal Empathy\n\nHALFLING: IMPERIAL\n   Halflings' small stature often belies the vastness of their precious Empire and the scope of their ambition. Every Imperial Halfling is trained in the arts of war from childhood and countless crusades against as many enemies have hardened them into a hard and unforgiving people. Disciplined and well-led, they make valued allies and intractable foes. \n   Favored Class: Fighter\n   Properties:\n      +4 Str\n      -4 Dex\n      +2 Con\n      -2 Int\n      -2 Wis\n      +2 AC vs Chaos\n      +1 AC vs Neutral\n      -1 Deflection AC\n      Martial Weapon Proficiency\n      10% Immunity to Bludgeoning\n      10% Immunity to Piercing\n      10% Immunity to Slashing\n      25% Vulnerability to Magical Damage\n\nHUMAN: AIR-TOUCHED\n   Lithe, graceful and free-willed, it is said the Air-Touched are distant descendents of the firstmen, born only among those of human ancestry.

Unlike their more reclusive, subterranean brethren, Tinkers are talkative and outgoing, wandering constantly from town to town in search of new supplies and markets for their often useless creations.

All the same, the jails of the land are often full of them, each one imprisoned for some crime of treason or passion or despair. It is said they love too fully, too impulsively, rarely able to see the wider consequences of their actions.\n   Favored Class: Bard\n   Properties:\n      -2 Con\n      -2 Int\n      +2 Wis\n      +2 Cha\n      +2 AC vs Evil\n      25% Immune: Positive Energy\n      25% Vulnerable: Negative Energy\n      10% Vulnerable: Fire\n      Light: Dim (White)\n\nHUMAN: TAINTED\n   Considered sullen and devious by some, resourceful and far-thinking by others, few seem to agree on the nature and origins of the Tainted. Given the aura of red light that seems to follow them, some argue that they must be devilspawn or agents of Stygia. More rational voices, however, insist that they must be lingering vestiges from the time of the firstmen, much like their elemental brethren, the Touched.\n   Favored Class: Rogue\n   Properties:\n      +1 Str\n      -2 Con\n      +2 Int\n      -2 Cha\n      +2 AC vs Good\n      25% Immune: Negative Energy\n      25% Vulnerable: Positive Energy\n      10% Vulnerable: Cold\n      Light: Dim (Red)\n\nHUMAN: WATER-TOUCHED\n   Mysterious, enduring, and mercurial, it is said the Water-Touched are distant descendents of the firstmen, born only among those of human ancestry. Such births are rare, often skipping many generations, but they are always seen as signs of great import.
