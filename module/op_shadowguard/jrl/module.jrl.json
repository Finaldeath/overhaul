The messenger claimed I should speak to Xanthar to learn more, and quickly departed before I could ask any further questions..."

A great blast shook through our home just as I approached its doors, assuredly killing all inside, including my father, in the raging inferno.\n\nI was only narrowly saved when a gleaming medallion lying upon the doorstep caught my interest.  Stooping to pick it up, I was not in harm's reach when the blast destroyed my home and killed my father...\n\n---- Journal Entry ----\n\nI spoke with my father in his Council Chambers, and he seemed quite concerned over my safety after the assassination attempt on my life.  He did not seem himself, making many vague mentionings of Ghaarak being in danger, while eluding any details as to what they may be.  I had never seen my father act in such a fashion, for he was usually quite direct in his dealings with others, including me.  \n\nAs the conversation came to an end, my father told me how much he cared for me, and seemed to be resigning himself to some sort of decision.  He said he was going to return to the Imperial Estate which we called home, and make a deal which would ensure my safety, and hopefully that of Ghaarak as well...  \n\nMy father told me he would prefer that I avoid our home for a short while, at least until he could conclude his meeting and send for me.  \n\nI was unsure of what to make of all this, and left with many questions unanswered, as well as feeling of unease...\n\n---- Journal Entry ----\n\nUpon arriving at my father's council chamber, I witnessed the end of his meeting with two other men, one named Vhorkas, an aged man who seemed well accustomed to battle, and a sorcerer named Harkon, whom I recognized from the incident in the Market District with that strange prophet.  \n\nThe three of them spoke for quite some time regarding issues I do not even claim to understand fully.  It seemed my father had placed some sort of gem, found at a strange excavation site in the Northern Reaches, under lock and key in the Imperial Treasury.  He seemed quite worried that this gem was having some sort of unusual effect upon all who came into contact with it.  The sorcerer, Harkon, pleaded with my father to allow him to take it back to a place called Zhantara, but my father refused his request.  In anger, Harkon left the chamber...\n\nAfter the sorcerer's departure, I overheard my father and the man named Vhorkas speak in length.  It appeared that they were old friends, and knew each other quite well.  My father spoke a bit about me, saying he was concerned over my safety.  This Vhorkas made a vague mention of me joining some \"order\" of his, but the conversation was cut short when my father finally spotted me and called for me to come speak with him..."

Perhaps he is correct in this matter, for I do feel as though a heavy burden has been lifted from me.\n\nBut now is the time to look to the future.  Who knows what it may hold in store?
