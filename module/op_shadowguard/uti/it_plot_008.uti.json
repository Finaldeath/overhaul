Properly created, constructs can aid in a variety of tasks at their master's command, from simple labor to fearsome allies in combat.\n\nOnce the initial construct is built, a task both expensive and complicated, it is necessary to find a power source to animate the construct.  For a stable source, it is strongly recommended that one use Irilium Crystals, often found in the southern lands of the Sharakhan Empire.  While a bit hard to come by in these northern frontier lands, Irilium is the only dependable source for animation of constructs, and other substitutes are discouraged."
