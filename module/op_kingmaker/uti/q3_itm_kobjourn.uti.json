One of the things you do manage to make out is that the kobolds don't really like working for the \"Master\", but everytime they try to quit, he makes their head's hurt.\nThe rest of the book has scribblings of strange animals that live in some kind of woods and have various adventures. The main character is rather round and seems to have some kind of honey fetish. Hardly surprising considering what you've noticed about the kobold tribe."
