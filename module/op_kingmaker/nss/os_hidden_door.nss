    This script runs on either the Hidden Trap Door
    or Hidden Wall Door invisible objects.
    This script will do a check and see
    if any PC comes within a radius of this object.

    If the PC has the search skill or is an Elf then
    a search check will be made.

    It will create a Trap or Wall door that will have
    its Destination set to a waypoint that has
    a tag of D_<tag of this object>
    The radius is determined by the Reflex saving
    throw of the invisible object

    The DC of the search stored by the Willpower
    saving throw.
