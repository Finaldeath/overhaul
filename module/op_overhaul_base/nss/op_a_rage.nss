    Ferocity (Improved / Greater)
    Intensity (Improved / Greater)
    Rage (Improved / Greater)

    Some creatures have the ability to enter a frenzied state that grants
    temporary ability score bonuses. This works in a similar fashion to
    Barbarian Rage. A creature can enter three different types of Frenzy
    available in the game, each of which has three versions that apply a +2,
    +4, or +6 bonus to ability scores. The duration of all forms of Frenzy is
    equal to the creature's Constitution modifier, in rounds. The three
    types are as follows:

    Ferocity: boosts Strength and Dexterity.
    Intensity: boosts Dexterity and Constitution.
    Rage: boosts Strength and Constitution.

    Note: Kept the duration of con modifier +1 round.

    Note: Fixed several bugs from the original scripts.

    Note: Not applying rage effects on top for now.
