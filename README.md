# NWN Overhaul Project

This project is a repository for tracking bugs and issues with the NWN Overhaul Project.

It also contains the Overhauled modules, including bugfixes and the like, which will later be available via. nwsync.

Sadly Hakpack and art data cannot be hosted on github due to LFS issues (due to forking).

This repo has copies of game data generated from the game Neverwinter Nights. I am modding this content but do not own the rights, and the data should only ever be used in the game Neverwinter Nights, copyright Bioware, Beamdog and Atari.
